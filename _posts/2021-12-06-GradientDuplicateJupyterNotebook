#Copying a Notebook in Paperspace Gradient

Within the project container for my fastai based project, I have a list of notebooks, one per chapter of the "Deep Learning for coders" book. 
To use one of the notebooks about classification as a template for my own image classification work I took the following steps:

1. Select your project after logging in to paperspace.
2. Click on the "open in Jupyter" icon on the left of the screen (it looks a bit like an open eye), once the gradient instance has been set up. 
3. From the list of notebooks, click in the check box next to the file you want to duplicate.
4. From the options that appear at the top of the screen, click "Duplicate".
