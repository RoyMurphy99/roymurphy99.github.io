Having followed the instructions to create an image classifier to identify different types of bear, in chapter 2 of "Deep learning for coders", I adapted that classifier to 
discriminate between bare rock and fossil containing rock. 

To do this, I used Bing image search to locate images of plain rock, and also images of fossils. 

I downloaded the images and trained a learner to distinguish between plain rock and fossils. 

The model classified 18 out of 21 images of fossils successfully, and only misclassified 1 image of rock as a fossil. So room for improvement.
As per the book's recommendations I dont want to spend the rest of my life trying to make it perfect, but I think my image search could be improved
(to get more relevant images back), which in turn could help to improve model performance. 

I have a small Tello drone, and it would be interesting to see if I could deploy the model for use when controlling the drone from a Python program running
on my laptop, and how effective it might be out in the real world.
